- 👋 Hi, I’m Jim, L.K. Yu
- 👀 I’m interested in C language. Want to code in C++ but has written code mainly .Net C# and MS sql though. Also familiar with VB.Net and PL/SQL. For machine learning, I use python. I have tried pytorch and tensorflow.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some small projects. If you are looking for contributors, I am totally okay to help as I think any projects expand my ability to code and improve my standard. My experience is if I encounter more styles, I could improve myself.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
Can find me here or on discord gundam1945#4307
